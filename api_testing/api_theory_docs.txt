# API - Application program interface between client and server.
# Everything is going to be  HTTP transfer, which is datga transfer based on request and response.
''' NOTE : while testing we have go to network in inspect section of web page.
Header > what is going on.
payload > what client given to us.
response > result from server
preview > It returns each results in response.

Development phase : Frontend dev > raise request to backend dev and get response then show in UI manner to US.
Tester : To make sure ene to end function that means frontend to backend is working fine.
  (FE give request to BE will provide response.How the FE is showing is called End to End testing).  '''

API Testing Activities: HTTP Methods
Method	  Activity             Type	                          Purpose	Safety & Idempotency
GET	        Read	            Retrieve                         data	Safe & Idempotent
POST	      Create	          Submit new data                  Neither safe nor idempotent
GET ID	Read (Specific)	      Retrieve one specific record	    Safe & Idempotent
PUT	    Update / Replace	    Modify an existing record	        Idempotent, but not safe
DELETE	    Delete	          Remove a record	                  Idempotent, but not safe

Exceptions and Warnings :Term	Description

ConnectTimeout : 	Raised when the client fails to establish a connection to the server within the specified timeout period (e.g., DNS lookup or TCP handshake takes too long).
ConnectionError:	A base exception raised for critical connection-related errors (like the server being offline, DNS errors, or network unavailability). It includes ConnectTimeout and HTTPError exceptions.
DependencyWarning:	A specific warning related to required external packages that requests depends on (e.g., urllib3 version issues).
FileModeWarning	A warning concerning potential issues with file handling, typically advising on best practices when passing file handles as data.
HTTPError	Raised for an unsuccessful HTTP status code (4XX client error or 5XX server error) when .raise_for_status() is called on a response object.
JSONDecodeError	Raised when the library attempts to decode a response body as JSON, but the content is invalid JSON.
ReadTimeout	Raised when the server fails to send data back in a timely manner after a connection has been established.
RequestException	The base class for all exceptions raised by the requests library. You can catch this single exception to handle all requests errors.
RequestsDependencyWarning	A synonym for DependencyWarning.
Timeout	A base exception that covers both ConnectTimeout and ReadTimeout.
TooManyRedirects	Raised when a request exceeds the maximum number of allowed redirects (default is 30), indicating a potential redirect loop.
URLRequired	Raised when a request is made without a valid URL.

Core Classes and Models     :   Term	Description

These terms refer to the main objects you interact with in the library.
PreparedRequest :	An internal model of the request after it has been prepared for transmission. It contains the exact bytes and headers that will be sent over the wire.
Request :	A simple container object used to prepare the data needed for an HTTP request before it is sent (e.g., URL, method, params, data).
Response :	The central object returned by calls like requests.get(). It holds the server's response data, including status code, headers, and the body content.
Session :	A highly recommended object that allows you to persist certain parameters across multiple requests (like cookies, default headers, and connection pooling).

Top-Level API Functions

These are the common functions imported directly from the requests library to perform HTTP verbs.
Term	Description
delete(url, **kwargs)	: Sends a DELETE request.
get(url, **kwargs)	: Sends a GET request (most common).
head(url, **kwargs)	: Sends a HEAD request (fetches headers only, no body).
options(url, **kwargs) : 	Sends an OPTIONS request (asks the server what methods are supported).
patch(url, **kwargs) :	Sends a PATCH request (partial updates).
post(url, **kwargs)	: Sends a POST request (sends data to create/submit).
put(url, **kwargs) :	Sends a PUT request (sends data to replace a resource).
request(method, url, **kwargs) :	The primary function that all other verb functions wrap around. Allows specifying the HTTP method manually (e.g., request('GET', url)).
session()	: A convenience function to create a new Session object.

Internal Modules and Other Attributes : Term	Description

These are modules and attributes used internally by the library or for utility purposes.

adapters :	Contains transport adapters (like HTTPAdapter) which provide the mechanism to interact with specific protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).
api	: The module that defines the simple, user-facing API functions like get() and post().
auth	: Classes and functions for handling various authentication schemes.
certs :	Logic for handling CA certificates used for SSL verification.
codes :	A dictionary-like structure providing easy access to HTTP status codes (e.g., requests.codes.ok instead of 200).
cookies :	Tools for handling and managing HTTP cookies.
hooks :	Mechanisms to attach callback functions to specific events during a request process.
logging	:The built-in Python logging infrastructure integration.
models	: The module where core classes (Request, Response, etc.) are defined.
sessions	: The module containing the implementation of the Session object.
status_codes :	A synonym for codes.
structures :	Data structures used internally, such as CaseInsensitiveDict.
urllib3	 : The underlying, low-level HTTP client library that requests uses to do the actual network communication.
utils	: Various utility functions (e.g., handling encoding, parsing links).

Note: Attributes beginning and ending with double underscores (e.g., __version__, __author__) are standard Python magic attributes that define package metadata like version numbers, author information, and module structure.
